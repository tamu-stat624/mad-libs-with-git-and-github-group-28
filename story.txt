Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear [1],

I am writing to you from a [2] spaceship in a [3] galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a [4] rocket in [5]. There are [6] Baby Yodas and thousands of Chewbaccas here! In the
Jedi temple there is a pool full of blue milk. I fall asleep each night on 
a promiscuous  bed of
velvet and dream of farting slowly. It feels as though I have lived here 
for
69 [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here 
now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
