Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear James,

I am writing to you from a stupid spaceship in a faraway galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a black rocket in May. There are 7 Baby Yodas and thousands of Chewbaccas here! In the
Jedi temple there is a pool full of blue milk. I fall asleep each night on a promiscuous bed of
velvet and dream of farting slowly. It feels as though I have lived here for
69 Light years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
Skydiving on a Tremendous Space shuttle!!

Best wishes,
Adolf
